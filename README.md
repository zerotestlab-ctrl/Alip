# 🔷 ALIP — Arbitrum Learning Infrastructure Platform

**Live Demo:** https://alip-demo.vercel.app/

ALIP is an **interactive onboarding and education platform** designed for the Arbitrum ecosystem.  
It enables creators, educators, and community builders to teach newcomers how to use Arbitrum through a structured, gamified, and visually guided interface.

The goal of ALIP is to reduce the learning curve for users and builders entering Web3 by providing:

✔ A *sandbox education simulator*  
✔ A *mission-builder toolset*  
✔ A *dashboard for tracking progress and analytics*  
✔ A *professional UX that feels real and trustworthy*

This project is a **non-functional MVP** built from a polished Figma prototype and deployed as a static frontend.

## 🧠 Why ALIP Matters

Web3 onboarding remains a barrier for new users. Many struggle with:

• Wallet setup  
• Bridging to Layer-2  
• Interacting with applications  
• Understanding transactions

ALIP solves this with a **risk-free interactive environment** that teaches users by simulation.

This demo shows the **potential for real product development** in the future.
